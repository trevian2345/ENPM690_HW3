This is a simple simulation created with GameMaker Studio 2.

The relevant source code is in the directory hw3/objects/obj_bot.
The code for the operation of the robot is found under this directory in the following files:
 - Create_0.gml (instantiation)
 - Draw_0.gml (end of every frame; for drawing to the screen)
 - Step_0.gml (middle of every frame; logic performed constantly)
These scripts are executed upon certain events, denoted in parentheses.
Object properties are stored in the .yy files.

I may convert this project to pygame in the future.
