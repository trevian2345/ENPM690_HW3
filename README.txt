This is a simple simulation created with GameMaker Studio 2.

Description:
This simulation is of a "car" that can move around in its environment by driving forward,
backward, or turning its orientation.  Control of the vehicle can be toggled between a
a human controller and autonomous control.  Controls are as follows:
 -    <up, down>:  drive forward and backward
 - <left, right>:  steer
 -           <T>:  toggle control between human and robot

Code:
The relevant source code is in the directory hw3/objects/obj_bot.
The code for the operation of the robot is found under this directory in the following files:
 - Create_0.gml (instantiation)
 - Draw_0.gml (end of every frame; for drawing to the screen)
 - Step_0.gml (middle of every frame; logic performed constantly)
These scripts are executed upon certain events, denoted in parentheses.
Object properties are stored in the .yy files.
I may convert this project to pygame in the future.
